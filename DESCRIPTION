Description: The package provides miscellaneous functions to transform
    numerical or character data, to support graphics and system tasks and to
    ease data type modifications. Numeric functions include the generation of
    triangular numbers and scaling of values to a defined range. Character
    strings can be modified to e.g. prepend zeroes to numbers, extract
    substrings by pattern or field or to reverse strings. Searching and
    replacing text for multiple patterns is provided including multicore usage
    supplied by the 'parallel' package. Plotting tools include a simplified
    version to obtain a colour palette from a chromatic circle. A quick way to
    create an empty plot is implemented as well as the support for plotting a
    grid of ggplot objects and export it to different graphic devices / file
    formats. Data type transformation functions provide ways to apply functions
    to a subset / grid of data.frames with multicore support. Matrices can be
    extended by their dimension names to squared matrices. Lower and upper
    triangles can be transformed to a data.frame containing also dimension
    labels. System tasks include the listing of all workspace objects with
    their properties as a data.frame and the removal of all objects in a
    workspace. To load several R data files, a function is implemented that
    imports multiple files situated in (sub)folders by pattern matching into a
    list object.
